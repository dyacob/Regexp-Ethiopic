# Regexp::Ethiopic

This repo archives the source code for the Regexp::Ethiopic package which was
initially submitted to CPAN on March 3, 2003. Aside from minor maintenance
as needed, no development is planned other than (eventual) expansion of
coverage to all of Ethiopic introduced in the Unicode standard since 2003.

See the provided [manual](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dyacob/Regexp-Ethiopic/blob/main/doc/index.html) for 
a review of the regex approach and explanation of usage.

The Regexp::Ethiopic package has a CPAN home [here.](https://metacpan.org/dist/Regexp-Ethiopic) with
more terse [documentation.](https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Ethiopic)
